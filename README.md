# Graphics
Inspired by the graphical math representation of 3Blue 1Brown, also a youtube who created a 3D cube model
<br />
## check-list for 3D cube rotation
- [X] create x,y coordinates
- [X] using that x,y coordinates, draw a line
- [X] make a function that draws a line
- [X] create x,y,z coordinates
- [X] rotate a line by using rotation matrix, according to x,y, z plane
## check-list for game of life
- [X] create a cell object
- [X] make a function that draws a cell
- [X] check cell's neighbours
- [X] apply four rules of game of life and render the cells   
## check-list for mandelbrot fractal
- [X] make a function that draws a mathematical function
- [X] make a function that zooms in or out
- [X] make a function that identifies which point is within mandelbrot set
- [X] make a function that draws mandelbrot fractal
- [X] map number of iterations it required to escape mandelbrot set to ascii code so that mandelbrot fractal looks visually better.
